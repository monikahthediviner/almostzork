  <p>Atop a cliff somewhere near the edge, you find yourself in a clearing, bathed in the soft ligt of a star-filled sky. A thick forest surrounds you, and a narrow path winds between two ancient trees.</p>
  <p>Although you cannot tell if its a path or a sudden drop you feel drawn to walk through the portal.</p>
  <p>Fortune favors the fool. You step through and are transported to another realm!</p>
